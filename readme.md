## Sentinel Data Generator
The Sentinel Data Generator for Microsoft Sentinel is a tool designed to help you create and generate data that can be used to build machine learning models for Microsoft Sentinel. The tool is user-friendly and allows you to customize and generate a wide range of synthetic data that can be used for testing and improving your machine learning models.

### Scenario
The generator works wit a hypothetical scenario. In the scenario, a company has a couple of employees. The employees always work on the same laptop with the same IP address. Some users have leaked their credentials. A adversary (hacker) is also using the companies resources.

### Features:
- Customizable Data Generation: The tool can be configure to change the amount of sign-in attempts generated by real users and by the adversarry.
- Data outputed to a CSV file and Microsoft Sentinel. The CSV allows you to easily use the data that is ingested into Microsoft Sentinel in a machine learning environment.

### See how it works
I have created a youtube video which uses the Sentinel Data Generator. You can watch it here:
